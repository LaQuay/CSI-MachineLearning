## Direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 
## The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit

## Getting the dataset
deposit <- read.table(file="./data/bank.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=TRUE, sep=";")
# We rename the target variable
colnames(deposit)[ncol(deposit)] <- "subscribed"
original_data = deposit # We make a copy to compare it later with our pre-processed data

# 45211 observations and 17 different variables 
# (9 categorical: job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contanct, month, poutcome and y)
dim(deposit)
summary(deposit)
# 11.70% of subscribed, so our model sholdn't have a higher error than this
# Data is very unbalanced so some models will adjust worse than others
sum(deposit$subscribed=="yes")/sum(length(deposit$subscribed))*100

## Let's have a visual inspection of the continuous variables before pre-processing
# Age seems ok
# The other variables are highly skewed so we will try to scale and apply log where we can
# We can do it for duration, not for balance since it has negative values and we don't want to lose data
# pdays can be converted to categorical: "not_contacted" (in previous campaign) and "contacted"
d.cont <- melt(deposit[,c("age","balance","duration","campaign","pdays","previous")])
ggplot(d.cont,aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free") + geom_histogram() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

## Let's have a visual inspection of the factor variables before pre-processing
# They seem ok so we won't be touching these variables
d.categ <- melt(deposit, measure.vars=c("job","marital","education","housing","loan","contact","default", "poutcome"))
ggplot(d.categ,aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free") + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

# This dataset needs a lot of pre-processing ... also it displays a good mixture of categorical and numeric variables
# In conclusion LDA/QDA may not the best choice, a good choice may be Logistic Regression. We will test also Naive Bayes and Random Forest and 
# choose the best model that fits our problem

            #### PRE-PROCESSING ####
#### Fixing skewness and scaling continuous variables
# The balance has negative values, so we can only scale it
hist(deposit$balance, col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='balance', main='balance histogram', density=50)
# There are 3766 for negative balance
# The only way to fix it is to delete this observations so we choose to leave it as it is since we don't want to lose data
sum(deposit$balance<0)
deposit$balance = scale(deposit$balance)

# duration, campaign and previous are all skewed, so we apply log and scale
hist(deposit$duration, col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='duration', main='duration histogram', density=50)
hist(log(deposit$duration), col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='duration', main='duration histogram', density=50)
deposit$duration = scale(log(deposit$duration+0.001)) # +0.001 to avoid -Inf

# Applying log and scale to campaign and previous has some undesired effects, so we will leave them as they are
hist(scale(log(deposit$campaign+0.001)), col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='campaign', main='scale(log(campaign)) histogram', density=50)
hist(scale(log(deposit$previous+0.001)), col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='previous', main='scale(log(previous histogram', density=50)

# pdays has most of values -1 (not contacted previously). 
# We make a categorical value with "contacted" for pdays!=-1 and "not contacted" previously for pdays=-1
hist(deposit$pdays, col='lightskyblue', border='lightskyblue4', xlab='pdays', main='pdays histogram', density=50)
deposit$pdays = cut(deposit$pdays, breaks=c(-Inf, 0.0, Inf), labels=c("not_contacted", "contacted"))
table(deposit$pdays)
plot(deposit$pdays)

#### Fixing "unknown" values

# There are 288 subscriptions for unknown job, we leave it as it is since we don't want to delete this data
summary(deposit[deposit$job=="unknown",]) 

# We could change the unkown values to NA (as well as the 0 previous contacts variables), this is useful if we use a Random Forest algorythm,
# but since it is not the case we leave it as it is

# We plot again after pre-processing
d.cont <- melt(deposit[,c("age","balance","duration","campaign","previous")])
ggplot(d.cont,aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free") + geom_histogram() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

# Now pdays is categorical
d.categ <- melt(deposit, measure.vars=c("job","marital","education","housing","loan","contact","default", "poutcome", "pdays"))
ggplot(d.categ,aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free") + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

# PREPARING THE TRAINING AND TEST DATA
## Since we want to use different methods, we need CV and a separate test set:

N <- nrow(deposit)
all.indexes <- 1:N

learn.indexes <- sample(1:N, round(2*N/3))
test.indexes <- all.indexes[-learn.indexes]

learn.data <- deposit[learn.indexes,]
original.learn.data <- original_data[learn.indexes,]
test.data <- deposit[test.indexes,]
original.test.data <- original_data[test.indexes,]

nlearn <- length(learn.indexes)
ntest <- N - nlearn

# a low p-value indicates that we can reject the null hipotesis, thus that variable has an importance on our model,
# a higher p-value means that we can discard that variable
# so we can fit the mode again with just the variable that actually have an influence on our model
# We can discard the following since they affect our model less: age, job, marital, default, balance, pdays and previous

# because the bank wants to contact only those clients that are more probable to subscribe to the loan
# We can see that accuracy is high (90.07 %), but precission is low (34.15%), to solve this we lower the threshold
# for which a client may subscribe a loan (the probability) compare the values again, since for the bank clients
# with 30% probability of subscribing is probably worth to spend it's ressources contacting them
